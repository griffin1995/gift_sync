          - VERIFIED: All prices in GBP currency
          - VERIFIED: Algorithm correctly prioritises high ratings + review volume
        
        Calculates product popularity using weighted combination of:
          - User ratings (70% weight): Higher rated products rank higher
          - Review volume (30% weight): More reviewed products rank higher
        
        Algorithm Details:
          - Rating component: Direct rating value (4.5/5.0 = 0.9)
          - Review component: Scaled review count (capped at 10 for balance)
          - Final score: (rating * 0.7) + (min(reviews/1000, 10) * 0.3)
        
        This approach balances quality (ratings) with social proof (reviews)
        to surface products that are both high-quality and popular.
        
        Use Cases:
          - Homepage featured products
